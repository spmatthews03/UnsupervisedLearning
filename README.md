# Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction

## Output
Output CSVs and images are written to `./output` and `./output/images` respectively. Sub-folders will be created for each DR algorithm (ICA, PCA, etc) as well as the benchmark.

If these folders do not exist the experiments module will attempt to create them.

## Clustering Experiments

The experiments will output modified versions of the data sets after applying the DR methods. The script `run_clustering.sh` can be used to perform clustering on these modified datasets, using a specific number of components for the DR method.

**BE SURE TO UPDATE THE VALUES IN THIS SCRIPT FOR YOUR DATASETS**. 

There are different optimal values for each algorithm and each dataset, and using the wrong value will make you a sad panda.


## Graphing

The run_experiment script can be use to generate plots via:

```
python run_experiment.py --plot
```

Since the files output from the experiments follow a common naming scheme this will determine the problem, algorithm,
and parameters as needed and write the output to sub-folders in `./output/images`.
